If you have an android phone, love programming, you should give this a try!

You'll need:
 - a github page created
 - setup the site with jekyll
 - install on your android phone(/tablet):
  - termux
  - in termux install git
  - in termux install vim
  - checkout your github pages repo
  - add posts

This blog was written this way :)
